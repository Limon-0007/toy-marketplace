          Q1. What is an access token and refresh token? <br /> How do they work and
          where should we store them on the client-side?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p className="font-semibold px-8">
            Refresh tokens allow you to balance your users access needs with
            your organization`s security practices. Access tokens help users get
            the resources they need to complete their tasks, but such tokens can
            also expose your organization to data compromise or other malicious
            actions if a hacker is able to steal them.

        SQL and NoSQL differ in whether they are relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL), whether their schemas are predefined or dynamic, how they scale, the type of data they include and whether they are more fit for multi-row transactions or unstructured data.
